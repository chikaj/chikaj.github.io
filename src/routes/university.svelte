      <p>
        I focus on GISience projects that integrate human-environment
        interaction. I do a few other things, too.

      <h3>Open Source</h3>
      <p class="section-p">
        I use as many open source tools as I can! That means QGIS, of course,
        but also Python-based tools like rasterio, scipy and TensorFlow. And for
        development, Docker with Django for the backend and Svelte for the
        frontend.

      <ul>
        <li>Geographic Applications of Remote Sensing (Graduate)</li>
        <p class="section-p">The is an accelerated course.</p>
        <li>Exploring Spatial Databases (Graduate)</li>
        <p class="section-p">
          This course begins with ontologies and geospatial semantics, advances
          to Entity-Relationship Diagrams, and concludes with basic to advanced
          SQL. PostgreSQL with the PostGIS geospatial extention is used in the
          course.
        </p>
        <li>Remote Sensing and Earth Observation (Undergraduate)</li>
        <p class="section-p">
          This course is an introduction to the principles and practices of
          orbital and sub-orbital Earth Observation.
        </p>
        <li>Advanced Geographic Information Systems (Undergraduate)</li>
        <p class="section-p">
          This course covers advanced raster and vector analyses in a GIS
