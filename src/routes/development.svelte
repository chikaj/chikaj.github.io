    Development
</h2>

<p>
    I like to build interesting things and I use a variety of tools to do that.
</p>
<p>
    For building database backends and APIs, I use <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>
    and <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org">Django Rest Framework</a>. Even
    <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/gis/">GeoDjango</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/openwisp/django-rest-framework-gis">Django Rest Framework GIS</a> 
</p>
<p>
    For frontend development, I really enjoy <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>.
    This website was built using <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev">Sapper</a>,
    which is based on Svelte.
</p>
<p>
    For data science, I usually stick with Python, including Jupyter Labs. Some
    of my favorite packages include rasterio and geopandas.
